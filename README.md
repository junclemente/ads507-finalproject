# ADS 507 - Practical Data Engineering

# Installation

For development, part of the code in this project is run using Jupyter Notebooks. Conda is used to manage the Python environment. A YAML file is available for this project.

## Development

### Jupyter Notebook and Environment

To setup and run this project, please follow these steps:

Using conda, install the environment:

`conda env create -f environment/ads507.yml`

If changes were made to the YAML file, you can update the environment by running:

`conda env update -f environment/ads507.yml --prune`

### MySQL Database and Workbench

Access to a MySQL database is also necessary for this project. The database can be created using the provide schema file and MySQL Workbench.

### APIs

Washington State Department of Transportion Traffic APIs are used as the datasource for this project. The API sources used are:

- Travel Times
- Highway Alerts
- Weather Information

More information for this APIs can be found at the [Washington State Department of Transportation https://wsdot.wa.gov/traffic/api/](https://wsdot.wa.gov/traffic/api/) website.

### Credentials

Access code to retrieve data from the APIs is required. To ensure privacy and prevent abuse, the credentials for this project have been stored in a `.env` file. To use the code provided in this project, a `.env` file must be created in the root folder of the project. The `.env` variables must then be uploaded into the environment. This can be done using the `dotenv` Python library.

## Production

For production, the notebook that runs the extract, load, and transform script was exported to a python script.

A CRON job can be used to run the script on a schedule.

# Project Intro / Objective

The objective of this project is to use highway and travel information from the state of Washington to create a dashboard of highway alerts, weather information and travel times. This dashboard will connect to a mysql database. The mysql database connects to the Department of Transportationâ€™s information via rest API and can be used to help end users make travel plans in Washington State.
